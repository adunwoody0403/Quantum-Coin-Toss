# Quantum Coin Toss

<p>A basic and experimental introduction to quantum computing. This program serves to simulate a fair coin toss by utilizing the quantum superposition of a single qubit in order to determine a random result with 50% probability of each outcome.</p>

<p>This is a python program and makes use of the Qiskit library in order to execute quantum operations. Using Qiskit we are able to run the quantum operations on both simulated hardware, as well as real hardware available within the IBM Quantum platform.</p>

<p>This program can be run on the cloud via IBM Quantum Lab. It can also be run locally by installing Python and Qiskit. To run locally you will need an IBM Quantum account. <a href="https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html">Click here for a more detailed guide.</a></p>
